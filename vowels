#The count_vowels function takes a word (string) as input and counts the number of vowels in it.
#It initializes a counter variable count to 0 and iterates through each character in the word using a for loop.
#Within the loop, it checks if the lowercase version of the character is in the string vowels, which contains all the vowels.
#If the character is a vowel, it increments the count variable.
#Finally, it returns the count of vowels in the word.
#In the __main__ block, it prompts the user to input a word, calls the count_vowels function, and prints the result.
